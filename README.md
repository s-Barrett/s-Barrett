## About

Systems programmer transitioning into cyber security and defence software. Background in low-level C/C++ development, embedded systems, and reverse engineering. I build tools that operate close to the metal — from custom game engines and embedded firmware to web scraping automation and data extraction pipelines.

Currently focused on offensive security tooling, network analysis, and secure systems development.
